/*
* This object ensures that the players are stored in the correct order
* the algorithm goes as such:
* - when a player joins the room, he is pushed in this.players
* this behavior is always true unless there's 4 players in the room
* at which point nothing happens
*
* - when a player leaves the room before the beginning of the game:
* he's removed from the array and every member after him is moved back
* (2 becomes 1, etc...)
*
* THIS OBJECT DOES NOT CARE FOR LOCAL PLAYERS
* This is the responsibility of the Lobby object
